# NativeXNA

**NativeXNA** is a high-performance C++ reimplementation of Microsoft's (defunct) XNA 4.0 framework. It aims to provide a fast, code-first game development environment for modern platforms, allowing developers to use the familiar XNA API without the .NET dependency. 

Currently only supports Windows 10+, although cross-platform support is planned for the future.
